# Fraudulent Transaction Detection  

## Overview  
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. 
By analyzing transaction patterns, the model effectively distinguishes fraudulent activities from legitimate ones, helping to prevent financial fraud.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of transaction records with various features, including amount, time, and transaction type.
Preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and data balancing were applied to improve model performance.
